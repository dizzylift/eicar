Please see [eicar.org](https://eicar.org) for several formats if you require a pre-made file. I don't know if Github would get upset at the file living here, and I don't feel like finding out.

## What is the EICAR string?

This is the "EICAR Standard Anti-Virus Test File" and was created as a way to check antivirus and antimalware software functionality without the risk of deploying a live virus to production equipment. You can read more about the development of the file on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EICAR_test_file).

## Why is this useful?

Running this file will (hopefully) trigger antimalware alerts, which can be then be observed and adjusted as required. You test (again, hopefully) your UPS hardware, backups, and smoke alarms, right? Don't forget to also test your antivirus and antimalware alerting too!
