## What is the EICAR File?

The "EICAR Standard Anti-Virus Test File" was created to verify antivirus and antimalware software functionality without the risk of deploying a live virus to production equipment. You can read more about the development of the file on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EICAR_test_file).

## Why is this useful?

Running this file will (hopefully) trigger antimalware alerts, which can be then be observed and adjusted as required. You (again, hopefully) test your UPS hardware, backups, and smoke alarms, right? Don't forget to test your antivirus and antimalware alerting!
