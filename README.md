## What is the EICAR string?

This is the "EICAR Standard Anti-Virus Test File" and was created as a way to check antivirus and antimalware software functionality without the risk of deploying a live virus to production equipment. You can read more about the development of the file on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EICAR_test_file).
